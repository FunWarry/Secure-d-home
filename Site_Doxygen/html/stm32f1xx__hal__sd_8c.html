<pre class="fragment">==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  This driver implements a high level communication layer for read and write from/to 
  this memory. The needed STM32 hardware resources (SDIO and GPIO) are performed by 
  the user in HAL_SD_MspInit() function (MSP layer).                             
  Basically, the MSP layer configuration should be the same as we provide in the 
  examples.
  You can easily tailor this configuration according to hardware resources.

[..]
  This driver is a generic layered driver for SDIO memories which uses the HAL 
  SDIO driver functions to interface with SD and uSD cards devices. 
  It is used as follows:

  (#)Initialize the SDIO low level resources by implement the HAL_SD_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the SDIO interface clock using __HAL_RCC_SDIO_CLK_ENABLE(); 
      (##) SDIO pins configuration for SD card
          (+++) Enable the clock for the SDIO GPIOs using the functions __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE();   
          (+++) Configure these SDIO pins as alternate function pull-up using HAL_GPIO_Init()
                and according to your pin assignment;
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_DMA()
           and HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_DMA() APIs).
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using __HAL_RCC_DMAx_CLK_ENABLE(); 
          (+++) Configure the DMA using the function HAL_DMA_Init() with predeclared and filled. 
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process when using DMA transfer.
          (+++) Configure the SDIO and DMA interrupt priorities using functions
                HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(); DMA priority is superior to SDIO's priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC DMA and SDIO IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
          (+++) SDIO interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_ENABLE_IT() 
                and __HAL_SD_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
          (+++) SDIO interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_GET_IT()
                and __HAL_SD_CLEAR_IT()
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_IT()
           and HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_IT() APIs).
          (+++) Configure the SDIO interrupt priorities using function
                HAL_NVIC_SetPriority();
          (+++) Enable the NVIC SDIO IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
          (+++) SDIO interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_ENABLE_IT() 
                and __HAL_SD_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
          (+++) SDIO interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_GET_IT()
                and __HAL_SD_CLEAR_IT()
  (#) At this stage, you can perform SD read/write/erase operations after SD card initialization  

       
*** SD Card Initialization and configuration ***
================================================    
[..]
  To initialize the SD Card, use the HAL_SD_Init() function. It Initializes 
  SDIO IP(STM32 side) and the SD Card, and put it into StandBy State (Ready for data transfer). 
  This function provide the following operations:

  (#) Initialize the SDIO peripheral interface with defaullt configuration.
      The initialization process is done at 400KHz. You can change or adapt 
      this frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field. 
      The SD Card frequency (SDIO_CK) is computed as follows:

         SDIO_CK = SDIOCLK / (ClockDiv + 2)

      In initialization mode and according to the SD Card standard, 
      make sure that the SDIO_CK frequency doesn't exceed 400KHz.

      This phase of initialization is done through SDIO_Init() and 
      SDIO_PowerState_ON() SDIO low level APIs.

  (#) Initialize the SD card. The API used is HAL_SD_InitCard().
      This phase allows the card initialization and identification 
      and check the SD Card type (Standard Capacity or High Capacity)
      The initialization flow is compatible with SD standard.

      This API (HAL_SD_InitCard()) could be used also to reinitialize the card in case 
      of plug-off plug-in.

  (#) Configure the SD Card Data transfer frequency. By Default, the card transfer 
      frequency is set to 24MHz. You can change or adapt this frequency by adjusting 
      the "ClockDiv" field.
      In transfer mode and according to the SD Card standard, make sure that the 
      SDIO_CK frequency doesn't exceed 25MHz and 50MHz in High-speed mode switch.
      To be able to use a frequency higher than 24MHz, you should use the SDIO 
      peripheral in bypass mode. Refer to the corresponding reference manual 
      for more details.

  (#) Select the corresponding SD Card according to the address read with the step 2.
  
  (#) Configure the SD Card in wide bus mode: 4-bits data.

*** SD Card Read operation ***
==============================
[..] 
  (+) You can read from SD card in polling mode by using function HAL_SD_ReadBlocks(). 
      This function allows the read of 512 bytes blocks.
      You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation 
      by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
      After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
      through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.
